## Nelson Book Pirater, The Problem:
A Canadian textbook hub, [mynelson.com](https://mynelson.com) only allows you to view pages in your browser. You can download the pdf's one by one, but the multiple directories where different pages are stored in makes this especially tedious.

## What does this script do?

Enter in your account credentials, or cookies for your account, and you'll be able to view the textbooks attached to your account and instantaneously download all the contents from them into a neat folder.

## How to use??

Run ```nelsonfrick.js```, and enjoy your locally stored textbooks!
