## Nelson Book Pirater, The Problem:
A Canadian textbook hub [mynelson.com](https://mynelson.com) only allows you to view pages in your browser. You can download the pdf's one by one but the pages are spread across many directories, making it difficult.

## What does this script do?

Enter in your account credentials, and you'll be able to view the all textbooks attached to your account and instantaneously download all the contents from them into a neat folder. 

## How to use?

Ensure you have a version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) equal to or greater than 20 for your platform.

Download `nelsonfrick.mjs` and run it with node. Follow prompted instructions to download your books.

This script may stop working due to Nelson updates. Please create a Github issue if you encounter any problems.
