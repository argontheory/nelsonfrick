## Nelson Book Pirater, The Problem:
A Canadian textbook hub, [mynelson.com](https://mynelson.com) only allows you to view pages in your browser. You can download the pdf's one by one, but the pages are spread across many directories which makes this difficult. 

## What does this script do?

Enter in your account credentials, or cookies for your account, and you'll be able to view the textbooks attached to your account and instantaneously download all the contents from them into a neat folder. 

There is an option to stitch the content into a single pdf.

You could then store content in other places, and distribute them if you want. (I AM NOT LEGALLY LIABLE IF YOU DO)

## How to use?

Run ```nelsonfrick.js```, and enjoy your locally stored textbooks!
